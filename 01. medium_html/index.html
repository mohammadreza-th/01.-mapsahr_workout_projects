            Ever wanted to redo CSS all over again, but with a new
            tool/framework?
          </p>
          <h1>What is it?</h1>
          <p>
            `styled-components` is a CSS-in-JS styling framework that uses
            tagged tiplate literals in JavaScript and the power of CSS to
            provide a platform that allows you to write actual CSS to style
            react components, while being boasted about its developer experience
            (also known as DX) and performance.
          </p>
          <p>
            But is the hype well-deserved or are developers being led astray?
          </p>
          <p>Let’s get the first thing out of the way.</p>
          <p>
            You basically write CSS, but in Javascript. You can actually name
            your tags so it’s easier to identify thi. Just for that, this tool
            is an automatic 10/10 for most React developers (myself included).
          </p>
          <p>
            You can also change the values of properties with Javascript. This
            is great for apps with dynamic content.
          </p>
          <h1>So then why not use styled-components for all projects?</h1>
          <p>
            The question I want to pose, would people still use it if they knew
            they are leaving 30% or more money on the table? No, they wouldn’t
            care about it at all.
          </p>
          <p>
            But in certain cases, it
            <strong>does</strong> affect the revenue of your app. One thing I
            learned during my time creating web apps for phones is that
            <strong>NOT</strong> all people (<i>surprinsingly</i>) use the
            latest iPhone. There are still people who use devices with Android
            4.4.4. I know, unbelievable!!!
          </p>
          <p>
            So before you create your new project with this technology (or
            before you change the current one in production), take a minute and
            consider how important is performance to your app.
          </p>
          <p>
            I couldn’t really find on the internet an article which talked about
            this, but it made sense to test the hypothesis that modular CSS may
            be more performant. So I spent a few days and switched the entire
            codebase of an in production app from styled-components to modular
            CSS.
          </p>
          <h1>Pain points of styled-components</h1>
          <ul>
            <li>one extra package</li>
            <li>bigger JS bundle</li>
            <li>
              affecting CSS performance? (what we’re trying to find out here)
            </li>
            <li>CSS files and JS files are not processed the same</li>
          </ul>
          <h1>How I measured</h1>
          <p>
            The process was pretty straight-forward, but of course I had some
            road blocks, more specifically where more logic was involved in the
            styling. The tests show the average between 3 runs on both
            Lighthouse and the Performance tab on Chrome. I have set throttling
            to
            <i>Slow 3G</i> and CPU throttling to
            <i>4x.</i>
          </p>
          <p>
            Without further ado, let’s see what Lighthouse had to say about the
            changes:
          </p>
          <h1>Lighthouse performance audit</h1>
          <h2>Styled Components Performance</h2>
          <p>
            Average performance range: 13809 ms<br />FCP: 2.2<br />SI: 9.1<br />LCP:
            13.1<br />TTI: 13.2
          </p>
          <h2>Modular CSS Performance</h2>
          <p>
            Average performance range: 8995 ms<br />FCP: 2.1<br />SI: 7.6<br />LCP:
            12<br />TTI: 12.5
          </p>
          <p>
            Wow, this is a very big difference, considering it’s almost the same
            CSS. In the performance range, we are saving 4814 ms, almost 5
            seconds! A 35% reduction. That’s insane!
          </p>
          <p>
            The boost in Speed Index and the other metrics is also pretty big,
            considering the fact that CSS rules are not changed at all.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, this increase happens with older devices, so don’t expect
            the latest phone to have the same metrics, but it paints the picture
            needed for us. If your product is used by people who use lower-end
            phones, you are missing on revenue.
          </p>
          <h1>Conclusion</h1>
          <p>
            You can use both technologies in React and achieve amazing websites.
            It’s just a matter of selecting the right tool for the right job.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you have a very highly customizable dashboard, where your usual
            users are on a desktop, it may not make sense to change your
            codebase to modular CSS. Whereas, if your users come from mobile
            devices, I would suggest to try and see how faster your website is
            with modular CSS.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’m expecting to see some of your personal results in the comments!
